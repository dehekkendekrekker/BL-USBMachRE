===== Connections =====
==== J2-6  stepper controller connections ====
Each header interfaces one stepper controller.
The pinout is as follows:

1) EN
2) D
3) P
4) +5V

This appears to be a common-cathode system that drives opto-couplers or 


==== J7-11 ====
This header exposes outputs



===== H2,H3: 74HC245D =====
Octal bus transceiver. Can either output bus A on B or B on A depending on the direction pin 1 an OE.

Operates at 5V

The reason they are on the board is to drive the opto-couplers on the stepper boards.
The design is strange though, the 245 has limited driving capability


DIR == 0, OE==0 So data flows from B to A.


===== Possible problems =====
74HC245 operates at 5V logic levels, yet the controlller works at 3.3V. 
I have tested the level shifting unloaded, and it seems to work. A 3.3V input does yield a 5V output signal. However, not sure with load!
